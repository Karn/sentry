## Code of Conduct
We like to keep things simple here.

- **Be courteous** in your interactions with others; we'd like to remain as laid back as possible and build cool things. If you think Trump would tweet it, then it may not be the way you want to get your message across.
- **Value opinions** -- disagreements can be a great tool to reason about your ideas and to get an glimpse into the ideas of others. Let's work to understand where others are coming from and reach productive conclusions.
- **Don't discriminate** -- everyone who writes code is welcome to do so.
- Finally, **be awesome**! It is a great thing to be able to write code, it can be difficult to share code with the world. We respect that, and hope there's something that you learn, and perhaps can teach us on the way.

This code of conduct is a short adaptation of the [Open Code of Conduct](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/).
